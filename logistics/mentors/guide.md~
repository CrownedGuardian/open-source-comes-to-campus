= How to help - a guide for mentors at OSCTC events =

Hi!  Thank you so much for volunteering to help at our Open Source Comes to Campus event!

You may be wondering what, specifically, we're expecting of you and what you can do to prepare.

[Say something that makes this not overwhelming for folks who don't like thinking and planning ahead.]

The contributions workshop is the last part of the day.  We've found that the best way to engage students is to provide them with clear structure and a lot of guidance.  However, students may not be interested in that structure.  We go over what else you can provide to students in the "other options for students" section below.

=== Overview of Workshop ===

Before the event, we'll identify between three and seven open source projects for students to work on in groups.  Which projects are selected will depend on the interests, experiences and skills of the mentors we have at the events.  If you have a project you want students to work on, you should let us know.  [Make that sentence more excited.]

At the beginning of projects time, there will be a brief presentation on each of the projects.  All projects will have a local mentor assigned to them.  In some cases, the local mentor will be the maintainer of the project, in which case there will be no remote mentor.  In many cases, the remote mentor will be the maintainer, in which case they'll be paired with a local mentor who has interest/experience with the project, or with the tools/languages the project uses, etc.  Students who are interested in the project will go sit with the local mentor for the project.

At that point, the maintainer (either remote or local) will go over the project structure in more detail, and students can ask questions.  We recommend that the local mentor record this hangout (see how) so that students who join the project later can reference it.  The students can then begin working on tasks.  As the students work on tasks, the local and remote mentor can help them.  Because the remote mentor only s
