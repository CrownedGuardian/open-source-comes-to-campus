= How to help - a guide for mentors at OSCTC events =

Hi!  Thank you so much for volunteering to help at our Open Source Comes to Campus event!

You may be wondering what, specifically, we're expecting of you and what you can do to prepare.

[Say something that makes this not overwhelming for folks who don't like thinking and planning ahead.]

[This is a compete guide.  Can we create a dynamically generated version based on who the mentor is?]

The contributions workshop is the last part of the day.  We've found that the best way to engage students is to provide them with clear structure and a lot of guidance.  However, students may not be interested in that structure.  We go over what else you can provide to students in the "other options for students" section below.
