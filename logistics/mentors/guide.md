= How to help - a guide for mentors at OSCTC events =

Hi!  Thank you so much for volunteering to help at our Open Source Comes to Campus event!

You may be wondering what, specifically, we're expecting of you and what you can do to prepare.

[Say something that makes this not overwhelming for folks who don't like thinking and planning ahead.]

[This is a compete guide.  Can we create a dynamically generated version based on who the mentor is?]

== Contributions Workshop ==

The contributions workshop is the last part of the day.  We've found that the best way to engage students is to provide them with clear structure and a lot of guidance.  However, students may not be interested in that structure.  We go over what else you can provide to students in the "other options for students" section below.

=== Overview of Workshop ===

Before the event, we'll identify between three and seven open source projects for students to work on in groups.  Which projects are selected will depend on the interests, experiences and skills of the mentors we have at the events.  If you have a project you want students to work on, you should let us know.  [Make that sentence more excited.]

At the beginning of projects time, there will be a brief presentation on each of the projects.  All projects will have a local mentor assigned to them.  In some cases, the local mentor will be the maintainer of the project, in which case there will be no remote mentor.  In many cases, the remote mentor will be the maintainer, in which case they'll be paired with a local mentor who has interest/experience with the project, or with the tools/languages the project uses, etc.  Students who are interested in the project will go sit with the local mentor for the project.

At that point, the maintainer (either remote or local) will go over the project structure in more detail, and students can ask questions.  We recommend that the local mentor record this hangout (see how) so that students who join the project later can reference it.  The students can then begin working on tasks.  As the students work on tasks, the local and remote mentor can help them.  Because the remote mentor only sees what gets asked of them on IRC, they are at a disadvantage.  The local mentor should do their best to read body language and engage students.  They should encourage students to ask questions of the remote mentor on IRC.  The remote mentor should communicate back to the local mentor as needed.  If the remote mentor needs to step away from the computer for more than a few minutes (which shouldn't need to happen, but may come up) they should not leave the local mentor in the lurch.  The remote mentor should keep in mind that the local mentor will be doing a lot more than they can see.

The local mentor has two additional responsibilities.  The first is one a student completes a task.  They should [walk through the bug report with students].

The local mentor may also find they have students who do not work on this project.  The local mentor can offer them three options.  Students can join a different project.  They can do the "Finding a Project" training mission [see link].  Or they can look in [a more free-form way], with the local mentor helping as requested.  If the local mentor is feeling overwhelmed with people to help, keep in mind that they can call over the floating mentors to help with any of these other options.
