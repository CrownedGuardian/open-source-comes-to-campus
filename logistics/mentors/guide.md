# How to help - a guide for mentors at OSCTC events

Hi!  Thank you so much for volunteering to help at our Open Source Comes to Campus event!

You may be wondering what, specifically, we're expecting of you and what you can do to prepare.  This guide goes over everything that's involved in being an Open Source Comes to Campus mentor.

## General Guidelines

## Activities

### Practicing Git

### Career Panel

### Contributions Workshop

The contributions workshop is the last part of the day.  Over time, we've come to believe that the most important thing we can do for students is to help them build an ongoing relationship with an open source project - not simply fix a bug or land a patch.  (Though it's awesome when they do!)  Accordingly, we're working to identify great projects for beginners with clear documentation, enthusiastic maintainers, and a bunch of approachable tasks.  The contributions workshop introduces students to those projects.

We've found that the best way to engage students is to provide them with clear structure and a lot of guidance.  But we also understand that students might not be interested in that structure.  We talk about what to do when that happens in the "other options for students" section below.

#### Overview of Workshop

Before the event, we'll identify and prepare [open source projects]() for students to work on in groups.  Which projects are selected will depend in part on the interests, experiences and skills of the mentors we have at the events.  We'll ask you about those and match you up with an open source project.  (Do you maintain an open source project?  Are you interested in helping students contribute to it?  If so, the open source project you're matched with could be your own.)

All projects will be assigned a mentor at the event.  Often, this "local mentor" will not be a contributor to the project.  In this case, they'll be matched up with a "remote mentor", who will be a maintainer of the project.  The two mentors will work together to introduce students to the project.  Occasionally, a local mentor will have an open source project they maintain.  In this case, there would be no remote mentor.

At the beginning of projects time, there will be a brief presentation on each of the projects.  Students will then go sit with the local mentor leading that project, where they will learn about the project in more detail.  Each project will have several tasks for students to work on.  Students can choose whether to work on a task alone or with others, but they will always be surrounded by others working on the general project and will have access to an in-person mentor familiar with their task.

Throughout projects time, mentors will help students communicate with their remote mentor, document their progress, and take steps into the community (joining IRC channels, leaving comments on issues, joining mailing lists, etc).  At the end of the workshop, there will be a wrap up where students and mentors talk about what they did.  Accomplishments like joining a mailing list or reporting a bug should be emphasized and celebrated as much as getting a patch merged.

#### Specific Responsibilities

To help you get ready for the contributions workshop, we'll go into more detail about the responsibilities of mentors below.

##### Before the Event

Projects need to be prepared for each event.  Although much of the work of checking development environment setup and creating good documentation should be already taken care of, there are a few additional things that need to be done.  (If you are a local mentor who wants students to contribute to your project, the setup work may _not_ be done.  We will help you with that!)

###### For in-person mentors

- When asked, provide feedback to organizers about your interests, experiences and skills so we can match you with a project.  If there is a specific project on our list you would like to be a mentor for, say so.
- Once you've been assigned to a project, go through the installation and contribution guides.  Give feedback to the remote mentor if anything is buggy or confusing.
- (Optional) Look through the tasks that have been chosen for the event.  Are the tasks clear?  Do they provide all the information a student would need?  Could you complete the task using this information?  Give feedback to the remote mentor as needed.

###### For remote mentors

- Go through your project and identify tasks for students to work on at the event.  You may find [this section of our guide](http://opensource-events.com/#defining-tasks-for-attendees) useful in doing so.
- Respond to feedback from local mentor re: your setup/contribution guides, as well as your identified tasks.

##### At the event

The local and remote mentor are a team.  The remote mentor is more familiar with the group's project, and should be able to provide clarification, feedback and insight when debugging.  The local mentor is able to see students as they work, and will be better able to notice signs of frustration, disengagement, or confusion.  The two mentors should be comfortable enough with each other that the local mentor can easily say, "Why don't you ask [remote mentor] about that in IRC?" or "Why don't you ask [local mentor] to show you that on your computer?"

###### For in-person mentors

- Respond as best as you can to questions and comments from students.  If you can't answer a question, direct students to the remote mentor on IRC.
- Help students document their progress via [bug reports]().
- Keep an eye on students and approach them if they seem bored, frustrated, or otherwise disengaged.  If they don't want to work on the project, direct them to the activities in the "other options for students" section below.

###### For remote mentors

- At the start of the contributions period, give a detailed explanation of your project to the group of students who will be working with you.
- Respond as best as you can to question and comments from students in IRC.
- Give feedback to pull requests and other proposed changes.  If possible, merge changes once you're satisfied with them.

##### After the event

Although we recognize that not every attendee will be immediately transformed into an impassioned open source activist, we'd like to try to follow up with each student.  To do this, we request the following from our mentors:

###### For in-person mentors

- Make sure the [bug reports]() you had students fill out make their way to the organizers.
- Pass along [notes]() on student experiences to organizers as well.

###### For remote mentors

- Try to merge any pull requests from the event within 48 hours.  For requests that can't be merged as-is, provide feedback.
- Go through the [bug reports]() provided by students and local mentors and add missing information. 
- Welcome and work with any attendees who continue to engage with your project.

#### Other options for students

There are several other options for students who don't want to work on one of the projects we've provided.  Local mentors can offer these options to students.

##### Option 1: the Finding a Project activity

For: students who don't know what project to work on

[This hand out]() guides students through the process of finding and evaluating open source projects.  It can be done in pairs, with a mentor, or by oneself.

##### Option 2: pair contributing with a floating mentor or other student

For: students who know what project they want to work on, but still need guidance

If a student has a project they want to work on, the can sit down with a floating mentor or other attendee and go through the steps of joining an open source project.  It may be more difficult for them to get a development environment set up, find tasks to work on, etc but some students will enjoy this more anyway.  

##### Option 3: complete freedom

For: the student who just wants to do their own thing

Sometimes students will just want to do their own thing.  Let them do it.  :)
