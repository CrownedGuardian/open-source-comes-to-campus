	    <h1>Open Source Comes to Campus Curriculum</h1>
		            <p>This page contains links to all of the curricula used at Open Source Comes to Campus events.  Its main use is as a source for event planners to browse, compare, and select activities for their workshops.  Overwhelmed by the options or not sure how these activities fit together?  Check out the sample schedules.</p>
		            <p>(You might also find this <a href="http://example-osctc-site.github.io/curriculum/">example event schedule</a> useful.)</p>
	                <p>Many activities have multiple versions, usually <b>self-guided</b> or <b>presenter-led</b>.  Some activities are specifically designed for small mentored groups, and those are marked as such in the notes, but many activities can be adapted to small groups.</p>
