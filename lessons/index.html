		            <p>This page contains links to all of the curricula used at Open Source Comes to Campus events.  Its main use is as a source for event planners to browse, compare, and select activities for their workshops.  Overwhelmed by the options or not sure how these activities fit together?  Check out the sample schedules.</p>
	                <p>Attendees of specific events may find the <a href="">event-specific schedules link</a> useful.</p>
	                <p>Some activities have multiple versions, usually <b>self-guided</b> or <b>presenter-led</b>.  Some activities are specifically designed for <b>small mentored groups</b> but typically, if your event is using small mentored groups, they will use self-guided or presenter-led activities based on the particular mentor's comfort level.</p>
	                <p>To add new activites, please leave a comment in the issue tracker, contact hello@openhatch.org and/or submit your changes as a pull request.</p>

                    <p>Career panels are an excellent opportunity for students to learn more about what being an open source professional is like.  If there are enough in person mentors we recommend running an in-person panel.  We can also arrange a remote career panel via hangouts (or a similar tool).</p>
