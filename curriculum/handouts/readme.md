This folder contains handouts you may want to print out for your event.  Precisely which ones you'll want to print depends on your schedule and how many attendees you have.

A few notes:

If you're running the open source communications tools presentation, you'll want the Communications Handout.  If you're running the small-groups git activity, you'll want the Practicing Git handout.  If you're doing a Contributions Workshop, you'll may want the Walkthrough handout, or you may not.

Most files have a .odt version for editing and .pdf version for easy printing.  These should be the same, but it's worth checking to see if they have different editing dates (you can see this by mousing over the rightmost column in the Github interface.)  If there's any confusion, feel free to ask us which is the better version.

#### Descriptions of handouts

###### Communications handout 
Files: Communications_Handout.odt, Communications_Handout.pdf
Description:  This handout is used in the Open Source communications tools lecture.  This is a paired activity, with one handout for every two people. 
Print: Print enough copies for the total number of attendees divided by 2.  So if you expect, say, 50 people, you’d print out 25 (or probably 30, since we recommend to print +5 just in case).

###### Practicing Git handout 
Files: Practicing_Git_Student_Handout.odt, Practicing_Git_Student_Handout.pdf
Description:  This handout is used to guide students through the Practicing Git activity. 
Print:  You’ll want one for each attendee, plus one for each staffer in case they want to use it to remind themselves of the order of the activity

###### Walkthrough handout
Files: walkthrough.odt, walkthrough.pdf
Description:  This handout is meant to help students walk through the process of contributing to an open source project.  The handout's utility is somewhat questionable.
Print:  If you're going for it, it's best to print out 2x the total # of attendees (as some students will need multiple, some will only need one).

###### Finding a Project handout
Files: FindingProjects_Student_Handout.odt
Description:  This is an activity to help students find a project to contribute to.  It's written as a paired activity.  We haven't used it very much yet.
Print:  If you decide to do this activity as a group, you'll need one per attendee.  If you decide to have it as a backup activity for individuals during the Contributions Workshop, you'll likely need fewer copies.

###### Bug Report handout
Files: bug_report_handout.odt
Description:  This is a deprecated version of the Walkthrough, so you likely don't want to print it.
Print:  Same rules of thumb as the Walkthrough handout.
